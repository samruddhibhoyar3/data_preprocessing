# Data_preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.<br>
When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. So for this, we use data preprocessing task.<br>
<br>
<b>Why do we need Data Preprocessing?</b><br>
A real-world data generally contains noises, missing values, and maybe in an unusable format which cannot be directly used for machine learning models. <br>
Data preprocessing is required tasks for cleaning the data and making it suitable for a machine learning model which also increases the accuracy and efficiency of a machine learning model.<br>
<br>
<b>It involves following steps</b><br>
1.Importing libraries(part1)<br>
2.Importing dataset(part1)<br>
3.Taking care of missing data(part2)<br>
4.Encoding categorical data(part2)<br>
5.Splitting the dataset into training set and test set(part3)<br>
6.Featuring scale(part3)<br>
